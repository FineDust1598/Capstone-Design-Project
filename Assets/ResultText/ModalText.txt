The <b>Complete XR Origin Setup</b> contains everything needed for a fully functional user interaction with XRI.

This includes head-mounted device tracking, controller presence, interactors, and locomotion. 

There are two core components that are critical to building XR interactions; <b>interactors</b> and <b>interactables.</b>

<b>Interactable</b> components define how the user can interact with objects in a scene.

That’s it! 
We can’t wait to see what XR experiences you build!
